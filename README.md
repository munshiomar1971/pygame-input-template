# what is python and pygame?

python is a programming language that has grown popular in the recent years because of its simple syntax and since it has so many modules and libraries it is very nice for begginners at programming.

pygame is a library/module/framework for python to make game the limitations are endless and you can do anything with pygame. Pygame is mainly used for 2d but you can do 3d if you really wanted to, aside from games pygame is also used as a gui module although TKinter is more reccomended.
